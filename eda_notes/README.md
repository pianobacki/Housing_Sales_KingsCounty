This is a collection of topup lessons with guided notebooks on miscellaneous EDA topics.   

## Set up your Environment

The added [requirements file](requirements.txt) contains all libraries and dependencies we need to execute the notebooks.

### **`macOS`** type the following commands :

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3

    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### **`WindowsOS`** type the following commands :

    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
